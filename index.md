# Native player documentation

## Design Philosophy

The SDK has three main structures; two classes and an interface. 
The BBNativePlayer class only has static factory functions for creating the views that do the actual work. 
The BBNativePlayerView class, which extends the platformâ€™s core UI View class (iOS: UIView, Android: View), is what you place in your layout. 
It offers an API to control the player (callApiMethod) and get/set player properties (getApiProperty/setApiProperty).
Finally, if needed, you make your own implementation of the 
BBPlayerViewDelegate interface and assign it to the player view in order to respond to events.
