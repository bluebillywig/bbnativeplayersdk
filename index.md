# Native Player SDK

## Design Philosophy

The SDK has three main structures; two classes and an interface.  

The *BBNativePlayer* class only has static factory functions for creating the views that do the actual work.  
The *BBNativePlayerView* class, which extends the platformâ€™s core UI View class (iOS: UIView, Android: View), is what you place in your layout. 
It offers an API to control the player (`callApiMethod`) and get/set player properties (`getApiProperty`/`setApiProperty`).  
Finally, if needed, you make your own implementation of the 
*BBPlayerViewDelegate* interface and assign it to the player view in order to respond to events.  

When creating a player view, you supply a json embed URL and (optionally) an options dictionary. The json URL is similar to Blue Billywig's standard embed URL. Its only difference is the .json extension, e.g. `https://demo.bbvms.com/p/default_standard/c/2431946.json` . Thus, it supports various content types (clip, playlist, project), and playout configurations.
