# Native Player SDK

## Design Philosophy

The SDK has three main structures; two classes and an interface.  

The *BBNativePlayer* class only has static factory functions for creating the views that do the actual work.  
The *BBNativePlayerView* class, which extends the platformâ€™s core UI View class (iOS: UIView, Android: View), is what you place in your layout. 
It offers an API to control the player (`callApiMethod`) and get/set player properties (`getApiProperty`/`setApiProperty`).  
Finally, if needed, you make your own implementation of the 
*BBPlayerViewDelegate* interface and assign it to the player view in order to respond to events.
