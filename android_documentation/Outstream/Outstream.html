<h1>Outstream</h1>
<ul><i>in the Native SDK</i></ul>

<h2>Outstream</h2>
<p>
When creating a player view, you supply a json embed URL and (optionally) an options dictionary. 
The json URL is similar to Blue Billywig’s standard outstream embed URL. Its only difference is the .json extension, 
e.g. https://demo.bbvms.com/a/native_sdk_outstream.json
</p><p>
A helper function exists for constructing it: 
createJsonEmbedUrl(baseUrl: "demo.bbvms.com", appIndicator: "a", appId: "native_sdk_outstream")
</p><p>
If the outstream ad needs to start collapsed and/or collapse on end, as per the adunit's (root-) settings, 
this has to be allowed explicitly via embed option 'allowCollapseExpand' = true.
Furthermore, the enclosing view needs to be unconstrained in the vertical direction; 
   android:layout_height="wrap_content" and
   at most one of app:layout_constraintTop, app:layout_constraintBottom
</p>
<h3>Unsupported</h3>
<p>
Some of the features of our web-based outstream offering are not (yet) supported in Native. For instance: <ul>
<li>Mouse-in action & Mouse-out action</li>
<li>Passback code</li>
<li>Placement options, incl. 'Wait for CMP response'</li>
<li>Prebid</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Pseudo-outstream</h2>
<ul><i>Click-To-Play & Ad-Only-AutoPlay</i></ul>
<p>
Again, when creating a player view, you supply a json embed URL and (optionally) an options dictionary. 
The json URL is similar to Blue Billywig’s standard player embed URL. Its only difference is the .json extension, 
e.g. https://demo.bbvms.com/p/default_standard/c/2431946.json . 
Thus, it supports various content types (clip, playlist, project), and playout configurations.
